# Cat Facts App

This repository will provide the host for all my code, for the react app and also provides a good point to start and have all the materials orgainize.

## Main goals

- [x] Using JSX build the app from scratch 
- [x] App Functionality using JavaScript
- [ ] Styling the app using a CSS react framework to learn how to use it
- [ ] Make API calls using axios for better underestanding and how is implemented in a real application
- [ ] Using the following api to build all the **CRUD** functionality: [cat facts](https://catfact.ninja/fact)

## Problems so far

- [ ] React recommends to destruct the Object to display their child elements, _Need to search how to do it_
- [ ] Consume the api, the data is displayed thanks to the use of a varible and using bracket notation i can display the elements

> This is for learning propurses don't use for real implementations :)
